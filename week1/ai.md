AI can be applied to a wide range of problems in financial modeling, particularly where relationships are nonlinear, data is high-dimensional, or conditions change over time. The main categories below reflect where AI adds material value over traditional deterministic or purely statistical models.

**Forecasting and prediction**
- Time-series AI models handle nonlinear patterns, regime shifts, and variable interactions for asset prices, volatility, rates, inflation, and macro indicators.
- Especially useful for short- to medium-term forecasts and generating diverse scenarios when deterministic econometrics struggle.
- Requires historical price/volatility series, macroeconomic releases, and high-frequency features when available to learn evolution and regime signals.

**Risk modelling and management**
- Gradient boosting and neural nets improve credit scoring, PD, LGD, and fraud detection by digesting many borrower and transaction features.
- AI also drives market risk work (volatility forecasts, stress testing, tail-risk) through high-dimensional data handling.
- Needs credit bureau records, transactional histories, collateral details, exposures, and market-factor time series to capture context and tail behaviors.

**Portfolio construction and optimization**
- AI supports asset selection, dynamic allocation, and factor timing under shifting regimes, constraints, and transaction costs.
- Reinforcement and supervised learning enable adaptive strategies beyond static assumptions.
- Relies on returns, factor exposures, liquidity metrics, transaction cost curves, and constraint definitions to evaluate candidate actions.

**Factor discovery and alpha generation**
- Feature learning mines large price, volume, fundamentals, and alternative datasets for new predictive signals or transformations.
- Commonly applied across systematic equity, futures, and options to uncover non-obvious interactions.
- Draws on extensive historical prices, volumes, fundamental filings, alternative data signals, and text-derived metrics.

**Valuation and pricing**
- AI creates surrogate models for complex or illiquid instruments (structured, private, path-dependent derivatives), trimming Monte Carlo runtimes while keeping accuracy.
- Needs granular contract terms, underlying asset histories, risk-free curves, and relevant stochastic inputs used in full valuation models.

**Scenario analysis and stress testing**
- Generative models simulate extreme but plausible risk-factor combinations, including nonlinear contagion, to test portfolio resilience beyond Gaussian assumptions.
- Requires joint factor histories, correlation matrices, macro stress paths, and portfolio exposures to generate coherent scenarios.

**Behavioral and sentiment analysis**
- Unstructured sources (news, calls, filings, social) feed sentiment/thematic signals into forecasting, risk, or trading models.
- Depends on text, audio, and social data streams with metadata for timing, speaker, and source weighting plus labeled sentiment where available.

**Operations and financial planning**
- AI-driven cash-flow, revenue, demand, and expense forecasts keep corporate finance, treasury, and FP&A adaptive to new information.
- Needs historical cash flows, budgets, operational metrics, sales pipelines, and macro inputs (e.g., interest, FX) to ground predictions.
