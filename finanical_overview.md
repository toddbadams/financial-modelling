# Financial Markets Overview

Financial markets are systems where buyers and sellers trade financial assets such as money, securities, and derivatives. Their core purpose is to allocate capital efficiently, manage risk, and enable price discovery.

## Types of Markets

### Local Exchanges

Local (or national) exchanges are regulated marketplaces where standardized financial instruments are traded.

Examples:

* Stock exchanges (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange)
* Futures and options exchanges (e.g. CME, Eurex)

Key characteristics:

* Centralized trading
* Transparent pricing
* Strong regulation
* Standardized contracts

### Over-the-Counter (OTC)

OTC markets involve direct trading between two parties rather than through a centralized exchange.

Examples:

* Corporate bonds
* FX spot and forwards
* Interest rate swaps
* Credit derivatives

Key characteristics:

* Customized contracts
* Less transparency than exchanges
* Counterparty risk (mitigated by collateral and clearing)

### Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)

ECNs are electronic systems that automatically match buy and sell orders.

Examples:

* Equity trading platforms
* FX trading venues

Key characteristics:

* High-speed, automated trading
* Often used by institutional investors
* Can operate alongside traditional exchanges

# Objectives of Financial Markets

At a high level, all market activity revolves around balancing return and risk.

### Maximizing Gain and Minimizing Loss

* Investors aim to grow their wealth over time.
* Risk cannot be eliminated, only managed.
* Successful investing focuses on achieving the best possible return for a given level of risk.

### Investors

* Investors have surplus capital.
* They seek returns through income (interest, dividends) and capital appreciation.
* Their primary concerns are return, risk, liquidity, and time horizon.

### Borrowers

* Borrowers need capital to fund operations, growth, or consumption.
* Examples include governments, corporations, and individuals.
* Borrowers accept funding in exchange for paying interest or sharing ownership.
* Lenders assess borrower risk (credit risk) before providing funds.

Markets exist to efficiently connect these two groups.

# Trader Types

Different traders participate in markets for different reasons. Not all traders are speculators.

## Hedgers

* Purpose: reduce or eliminate risk.
* Use derivatives to protect against adverse price movements.
* Examples:

  * Airlines hedging fuel costs
  * Exporters hedging FX exposure
* Hedgers often give up some upside in exchange for certainty.

## Market Makers

* Purpose: provide liquidity.
* Continuously quote prices to buy (bid) and sell (offer or ask).
* Earn profits from the bid–offer spread.
* Reduce transaction costs for other participants.
* Take on short-term inventory risk.

## Proprietary Traders

* Trade the firm’s own capital.
* Objective is to generate profit from market movements.
* May use:

  * Directional bets
  * Arbitrage
  * Statistical and quantitative strategies
* Profits and losses belong to the firm, not clients.

# Financial Mathematics

Financial math provides the tools used to price assets, measure risk, and evaluate strategies.

## Pricing Models

Pricing models estimate the fair value of an asset.

### Relative Value

* Compares similar instruments to identify mispricing.
* Example:

  * Comparing two bonds with similar maturity and credit risk
  * Comparing valuation multiples (P/E, P/B) across stocks
* Assumes similar assets should trade at similar prices.

### Arbitrage

* Exploits price differences for the same or equivalent asset.
* In theory:

  * Buy low, sell high simultaneously
  * No risk and no capital required
* In practice:

  * Rare and short-lived
  * Transaction costs and execution risk matter

---

## Risk Management

Risk management is central to long-term survival in markets.

### Position Sizing

* Determines how large a position should be.
* Prevents a single loss from causing catastrophic damage.
* Often expressed as a percentage of total capital.

### Portfolio Optimization

* Combining assets to improve risk-adjusted returns.
* Diversification reduces exposure to any single risk factor.
* Correlation between assets is critical.

### Capital Allocation

* Deciding how much capital to assign to each strategy or asset.
* Balances conviction, risk, and opportunity cost.

### Leverage

* Using borrowed money to increase exposure.
* Amplifies both gains and losses.
* Excessive leverage is a common cause of failure.

### Liquidity Risk

* Risk of being unable to exit a position at a fair price.
* Illiquid assets can suffer large losses during stress periods.

### Counterparty Risk

* Risk that the other party to a trade defaults.
* Especially important in OTC markets.
* Managed through collateral, clearing houses, and credit limits.

### Behavioral Risk: Human Psychology

Markets are influenced by human behavior.

* Risk aversion: fear of losses outweighs desire for gains
* Greed: excessive risk-taking during strong markets
* Fear: panic selling during downturns
* Emotional decision-making often leads to poor outcomes

## Trading Strategy

A trading strategy defines how decisions are made.

Key components:

* Entry rules: when to buy or sell
* Exit rules: when to take profit or cut losses
* Risk rules: how much to risk per trade
* Time horizon: short-term vs long-term

### The “Perpetual Money Machine” Myth

* There is no guaranteed, risk-free strategy.
* All strategies experience drawdowns.
* Sustainable success depends on:

  * Discipline
  * Risk control
  * Adaptation to changing market conditions

# Efficient Market Theory

Efficient Market Theory (EMH) suggests that asset prices reflect all available information.

### Core Ideas

* Prices adjust quickly to new information.
* Consistently outperforming the market is difficult.
* Excess returns are compensation for taking risk.

### Zero-Sum vs Non-Zero-Sum

* Trading costs make markets slightly negative-sum for participants.
* One trader’s gain often comes from another’s loss.

### Reality: Imperfect Efficiency

* Markets are not perfectly efficient.
* Humans are irrational.
* Behavioral biases, constraints, and delayed reactions create opportunities.
* Skilled participants aim to exploit these inefficiencies before they disappear.
